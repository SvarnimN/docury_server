What are the advantages of using self-attention in language modeling compared to sequence-aligned RNNs or convolution?,"['<1-hop>\n\n1 Introduction\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [35, 2, 5]. Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures [38, 24, 15].\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states h t , as a function of the previous hidden state h t -1 and the input for position t . This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.', '<2-hop>\n\n2 Background\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequencealigned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [34].\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequencealigned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].']","The advantages of using self-attention in language modeling compared to sequence-aligned RNNs or convolution include the elimination of the inherently sequential nature of computation, which precludes parallelization within training examples. This is critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. The Transformer, which relies entirely on self-attention, computes representations of its input and output without using sequence-aligned RNNs or convolution, offering potential improvements in both computational efficiency and model performance.",,,,multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

Each layer has two sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, positionwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm( x +Sublayer( x )) , where Sublayer( x ) is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension d model = 512 .']","The decoder in the Transformer model architecture contributes to its superior performance in machine translation tasks through its design, which includes a stack of identical layers. Each layer in the decoder consists of a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network, both wrapped with residual connections and followed by layer normalization. This design allows the decoder to effectively process and generate sequences, leading to improved translation quality as evidenced by the model achieving a 28.4 BLEU score on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task and a 41.8 BLEU score on the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task.",,,,multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
